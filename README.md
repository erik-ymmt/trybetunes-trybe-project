## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, I developed a music application. The user can search for artists listed on the '[iTunes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html)'. My goal was to develop a page based on the requirements given by '[Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'.
	
## Requirements Overview:
- [x] Login Page;
- [x] Search the API for an artist/band;
- [x] List the artist albums;
- [x] List the album's songs;
- [x] Favorite a song;
- [x] Profile Page;

## Skills Developed:
- [x] Request and consume data from an API;
- [x] Use React Components' Lifecycle;
- [x] Work with `setState` asynchronicity;
- [x] Apply `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch` and `Link` correctly;
